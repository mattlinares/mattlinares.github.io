			<p>They do not call themselves ‘artists’, but their creations 
mesmerize and challenge passers-by. They are shun by traditional auction
 houses and most museums, but might be the future of art. We met the 
new-media art scene in Belgrade last week, at the Resonate festival.</p>

			<p>Belgrade has been announced to us as the new Berlin. Serbia was 
hit hard by the financial crisis. That’s the first thing locals mention.
 Berlin’s flamboyant mayor Klaus Wowereit is notoriously close to his 
city’s cultural class. Dragan Đilas, Belgrade’s mayor until late 2013, 
is a mass media mogul, who has brought Big Brother to Serbia. 
Performance artist Marina Abramović, who exposed at the New-York 
Guggenheim and works with Lady Gaga, is from Belgrade. The Museum of 
Contemporary Arts collection holds works by Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, 
George Maciunas and Hannah Wilke. When it opened in 1958 it was one of 
Europe’s first national museums of modern art. Since it closed for 
renovation works in 2007 it has been slowly transforming into a ruin. 
Government funding has run out.</p>

			<p>Belgrade is setting out to fulfill the “poor, but sexy” promise, 
that Wowereit famously made about Berlin a decade ago. A young 
generation of artists is bringing the city to the center stage of the 
art scene. Its cheap rents are turning it into a safe haven for creative
 types. In <a href="http://www.mercer.de/press-releases/1420615" target="_blank">cost of living surveys</a> Belgrade regularly ranks far better than Berlin or other cities famous for their bohemian scenes such as Portland or Istanbul.</p>

			<p>Concept stores, galleries, coworking spaces and creative agencies 
are popping up all over the old centre along the banks of the Sava River
 and towards the Danube. Artists, tinkerers and hackers are at the 
forefront of this development. Milos Rancic, the founder of Hacklab 
Belgrade on the borders of the city centre, thinks young Serbs’ taste 
for computer code goes back to inventor and futurist Nikola Tesla. 
Rancic has been working on free software projects for over a decade. 
“People aspire to be as inventive with electronics as Tesla”, he says as
 he takes a sip of his energy drink and lights another Davidoff 
cigarette.</p>

			<div class="legend map">500 participants from 184 cities.</div>

			<p>Around Studentski Square in the centre of Belgrade, the Resonate 
festival, organized by Maria Jelesijević, a Belgrade-based visual 
artist, and Filip Visnjic, an architect living in London, is bringing 
together code artists from 184 cities. It's an intimate crowd of only 
500 participants. The tickets of have been sold out for months.</p>

			<p>Space not taken up by laptops is covered with cables, duct tape, 
and circuit boards. Multicolored running shoes navigate their way 
through narrow staircases filled with smoothie-fueled chatter. A mix of 
games, performances, data visualizations, interactive installations and 
artificial intelligence projects is presented in front of bulging 
lecture theatres. The digital arts circus has put up its tents in 
Belgrade. It’s the first day of Resonate festival.
			</p>
			<p>
			Some participants have already arrived a couple of days before the 
official launch of the festival. They’ve been trading insights in 
workshops on coding with light, face manipulation, or specific 
frameworks for algorithmic art. They often know each other from previous
 collaborations or hackathons that rarely last longer than a couple of 
days. The new-media art community is small. Few coders work with the 
software tools these artists develop. Programming environments like 
OpenFrameworks, Cinder and vvvv are exotic concepts even for regular 
programmers. At Resonate festival they are omnipresent. Artists use them
 to control light, sound, visual elements on screen and program 
interactions involving the audience or physical objects. Many manipulate
 so called Arduinos, mini-controllers that transform inputs from sensors
 into outputs to lamps, motors or musical instruments.

			<p>There’s a video that participants routinely refer to, in which the
 Japanese artist Daito Manabe makes his face dance to music. Manabe’s 
goal is to create a device that automatically transmits the expression 
of one face onto another. For one of the early test performances Manabe 
sticks myoelectric sensors, usually used for medical examinations, and 
uses electric impulse generators to make his facial muscles move to 
music.</p>

			<p>Technological advances and the creation of new devices constantly 
change the way new-media artists work. They provide them with new 
physical and digital materials and create the social shifts their work 
reflects. Google Glass is ostensively absent at Resonate festival and 
speakers at panels loathe its privacy infringing features. But most 
new-media artists are obsessed with data. The more sensors collect, the 
more raw material for data-based art. Some run apps on their phones 
which meticulously measure every step they make. Graphic designer 
Nicholas Felton even publishes ‘Personal Annual Reports’ that reflect 
his life in charts and visualize his daily routines.</p>

			<p>The default behaviour of many new-media artists is open source. 
That means that they often share the code of their art works with the 
public and allow people to build upon it - often before completion 
itself. They rely on programming languages and environments that are 
collectively developed. Resonate festival is not an exhibition or an art
 fair. Its open format, discussions and space for creation rather 
resembles a university.</p>

			<p>Kyle McDonald, Daito Manabe, and Klaus Obermaier sit on stage 
behind a table that looks as if it was build out of gigantic wooden 
bricks. The three artists have just finished their collaboration on a 
code-based performance piece they have called ‘Transcranial’. It mixes 
dancing, distortion of filmed body parts, and Manabe’s notorious 
electric impulses on the performer's face. They show fragments that have
 inspired their work, such as a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/nstv/2011/04/how-a-magnet-can-turn-off-speech.html" target="_blank">video</a> of a reporter who gets his speech centre temporarily switched off by a magnet in front of a camera.</p>

			<p>They also demo bits and pieces of the code they have written for 
it. At the end of their talk they share a link that points to the <a href="https://github.com/kylemcdonald/transcranial" target="_blank">public repository</a>, which hosts the performance's source code.</p>

 				<div class="body">Thanks for fixing our code and thanks for not adding any glitches that will make people destroy their brains</div>
 				<div class="author">Kyle McDonald, F.A.T., New York</div>
 			</div>

 			<p>McDonald, who is a fellow at the Free Art and Technology Lab 
(F.A.T.), even accepts to work for less money as long as his code 
remains open to the public. F.A.T. is a small collective of artists who 
criticize intellectual property law and produce pop culture for the 
public domain. In 2012 New York Magazine art critic Rachel Wolff <a href="http://nymag.com/arts/art/rules/sarah-sze-2012-4/" target="_blank">recommended</a> aspiring artists to “make art that’s difficult to collect”. The new-media bohemia is following this recipe rather closely.</p>

			<p>The global art market is worth around <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-12/global-art-market-surged-to-66-billion-in-2013-report.html" target="_blank">$70 billion</a>.
 New-media art has been missing out. The first computer art exhibitions 
were staged in the 1960s. The first major art auction dedicated to 
new-media art was only organized in autumn 2013. It was hosted by 
Phillips, one of the traditional fine arts auction houses, but the 20 
works on display have only brought in the modest sum of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/katherynthayer/2013/10/22/going-once-going-twice-phillips-puts-gifs-on-auction/" target="_blank">$90,600</a>. Even paintings by newcomer artists featured in the company’s <a href="http://www.phillips.com/auctions/auction/UK010314" target="_blank">“more accessible” auctions</a> sell for double. The price for a Banksy can be $500,000.</p>

			<p>The new-media bohemia publishes its work and shares code online. 
It does not seem to care about the rules of the art market whose 
thousands of collectors crave scarcity and exclusivity. But they also 
have to pay their rent. When a collector offers to buy new-media art 
shared on the internet, artists have agreed to transfer the ownership of
 the pieces domain or to take it <a href="http://ca.blouinartinfo.com/visual-arts/article/38508-can-digital-art-make-money" target="_blank">offline</a>. Wutang Clan have taken a more radical approach by producing only <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/03/26/why-wu-tang-will-release-just-one-copy-of-its-secret-album/" target="_blank">one copy</a> of their latest album.</p>

			<p>Andreas Müller, an artist from London, is packing up four black 
boxes that read “Oculus Development Kit”. Their content looks like 
inflated ski goggles with an inside facing tablet screen in the visual 
field. He has finished his workshop on Oculus Rift, the virtual reality 
headset that was bought by Facebook for $2 billion. The founders of 
Oculus had turned to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to raise 
$250,000 - they collected ten times as much. Some of the participants at
 Resonate have managed to do the same for their products - amongst them a
 print magazine called HOLO (raised $70,000), and NeoLucida ($424,000), a
 prism on a stick that helps make realistic drawings.</p>

			<p>If Resonate were a music festival, Aaron Koblin would be 
headlining it. The organizers have reserved the very last slot for his 
talk. His 2011 TED talk has been viewed over 1 million times and his 
work has been shown at MoMa in New York and Centre Pompidou in Paris. 
Aaron Koblin’s day job is at Google, where he directs the Data Arts 
Team. His data visualization and crowdsourcing pieces make playful use 
of the ecosystem created by technology giants. Amazon runs a platform 
called Mechanical Turk, where anybody can hire microworkers for simple 
tasks.</p>

			<!-- enter screenshot of Aaron Koblin TED talk, Why?-->

			<p>Aaron Koblin decided to make people draw sheep. One sheep cost him
 $0.02. 7599 participated, making an average hourly wage of $0.69. Only 
one asked in computer-mouse-drawn letters: “Why? Why are you doing 
this?”</p>

			<p>Rachel Binx and Sha Hwang used to visualize data for clients such 
as MTV and Oprah Winfrey. Then they quit and built Meshu, which is an 
online shop selling customized jewelry. The form of the jewels is based 
on a map of places that matter to the buyer. For a whopping $80, you can
 buy your own pendant made of bamboo wood or metal.</p>

			<p>Their next commercial project, Gifpop, helps turn Gifs from 
digital artifacts into physical objects. The outcome is a website 
offering to print Gif-files on lenticular cards, which change their 
appearance when they get tilted ($25 each).</p>

			<p>Now, they have even become Gif-gallerists selling works created by
 artists they display in the shop. They share the profits 80 to 20 - in 
favour of the artist. “Paying artists for their work is really 
rewarding,” Binx explains at the end of their session, “I love writing 
checks to people.” ▪</p>
