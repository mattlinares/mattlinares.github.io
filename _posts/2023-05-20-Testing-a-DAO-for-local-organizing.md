The promise of DAOs for organisations of all sorts remains one of the great hopes of blockchain afficionados. Cutting out centralised systems (), transparent finance and voting, programmable structures are all part of the allure.

We'll only really know if they can help by trying them out, so I've started experimenting in settings where they might be useful.

Such mini-DAOs let us test examine how they can work to solve a certain problem and also allow an organisation to test how they fit with their work flows.

## A DAO to manage a social centre’s building storage

Here's a test DAO with a social design group to manage the design of better storage solutions for the organisation’s event space. The budget is a small amount ~£200 from the organisational budget. 

We needed to explain how the DAO would be used by the members, for what actions, at what cost, and for what benefit. I created this resource, [**DAOs in practice**](https://www.crypticalstudios.com/daos-in-practice), to help.

Then, we began testing with an actual DAO, tracking actions here:
