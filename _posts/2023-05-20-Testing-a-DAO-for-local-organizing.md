## Testing DAOs for local organising

The promise of DAOs for organisations of all sorts remains one of the great hopes of blockchain afficionados. Cutting out centralised systems (), transparent finance and voting, programmable structures are all part of the allure.

We'll only really know if they can help by trying them out, so I've started experimenting with them in settings where they could well help.




Suggestion: Designing better storage solutions/management for the organisation's social centre. Budget is a small amount of money ~Â£200 from the organisational budget.
