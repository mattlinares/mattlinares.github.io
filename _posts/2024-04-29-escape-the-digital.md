What would life be like without digital devices? How would you communicate? How would you make ends meet? 

Are you capable of it at all? Or are you trapped?

**Escape the Digital** is a one-day retreat exploring practices for a non-digital life, including a role-playing game to test your potential in the analogue world.

The day’s agenda
----------------

The day starts at 10am as we stow digital devices and reflect on our objectives:

- Learn to cut digital devices out of your routine.
- Reflect on how you use them and how you would exist without.
- Develop alternative, analogue routines that you can use going forward.

</div>

Next, we warm up with analogue activities for expression such as thoughtful letter-writing. These pen and paper techniques can boost productivity and expand your imaginative horizons whilst displacing machine habits.

In the afternoon, we dive into a specially designed LARP: you’ll enter the analogue job market. With help from the career advisor, you consider suitable analogue professions, create a CV poster, put it up on local walls, and await the results. Before the day’s out, you may well have found a new job and got paid, all with no reliance on digital devices.

This playful escapade questions your ability to get by outside of the fragile constraints of the digital realm.

Just before we end at 6pm, we will review our findings, the letters we've written, and pledge to weave these approaches into our daily life.


Come and grow your analogue self
----------------------------

Escape the Digital is a visionary detox event designed to boost your non-digital qualities and spark positive behaviours of change.

Take this opportunity to build a more digitally-independent you.
