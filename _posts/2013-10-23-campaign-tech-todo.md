Here is an exploratory list of possible, progressive web projects. These are a mix of experimental protest and civil innovation .

If any of these are already in existence, I'd [love to hear about it](, if not, I'd be intrigued to see someone make them.


UK Web Filter Solidarity
------------------------

The UK government [has introduced](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2013/sleepwalking-into-censorship) a default filter on all web connections to block porn, extremist but also *esoteric* and other material of questionable relevance.

The law is problematic for various reasons.

It has already led to sites, such as sex education resources, being improperly blocked. The most appropriate illustration of how fallible this law is comes as the [Porn filter blocks website of MP who campaigned for it](http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/porn-filter-blocks-website-of-mp-who-campaigned-for-it-50013120/)

Besides this, there are strong arguments against forcing all web users to declare their intention to download porn and other 'deviant' material. Designed to protect children from troubling content online, the law would shift responsibility from parents who give children web access to others who access that which the government finds unsavoury.

	"If you give your kids an internet connection, it must be your responsibility to keep them from viewing bad things, as much as it is to keep them clear of baddies on the streets and ensure their friends aren't bullying them."


General esoterics

Aside from cheeky fiddlers, fans of other kinds of web material face 

– Repository and api (wordpress call, cms import?) to allow site owners to insert 'esoteric' material in their site to protest the opt-out internet filter


– hive mind. repository of facebook (and other accounts) you can use to log in as someone else on facebook and share with other people, etc. disrupt mining efforts

- what is terrorism?



Citizen's privacy security
--------------------------

As experts and laymen scramble to make sense of the new

Death party playlist / Cultural will
------------------------------------

Want boring old pa to choose the sounds at your funeral? Definitely not. Make your final playlist here, and while you're at it, define the terms of the entire party. Where should the wake be, who can come, even your recommendations for who should get together – cupid from beyond the grave.
