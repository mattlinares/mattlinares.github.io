People everywhere are defacing their own MacBooks due to poor design. Troubled by the ever-ready, built-in cameras, pointing surreptitiously into your life, [too easily hacked without warning](http://www.businessinsider.com/macbook-webcam-spy-hack-2013-12), users end up sticking tape and allsorts atop otherwise slick designs.

Of course, it's not just MacBooks. It's device which follows us with a peering eye. Laptops, phones, cars, watches, spectacles and much more are being fitted with cameras, much to the discomfort of folk who feel that glaring threat.

How do you feel when you realise your mobile lens is angled your way as you sit on the toilet?

Many feel moved to act and patch up the voyeuristic threat with makeshift bits of paper and other bodges. It's a quick response to poor design on the part of companies who decide that the risk to our privacy is worth for quick cam access.

It's time they built out Orwellian design. At least give us a choice by adding a lens cover as is common in other cameras. The alternative is an active rebellion against the products, as catalogued by this new Tumblr.

Send me your images of own DIY custom de-surveillance customisations to post on the blog. Companies need to know their products are being uglified on mass.

This is just one small effort to claw back privacy.
