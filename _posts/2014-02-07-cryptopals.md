As interest grows in data self-defence, more people are learning to encrypt their own emails. Often, they will learn the skills but find they have nobody to practice with.

The skill may fade and their enthusiasm to protect their data goes to waste.

One answer is to find a pen pal to share encrypted emails with.

So I made [cryptopals.org](http://www.cryptopals.org "cryptopals.org").

Find yourself a friendly stranger or make yourself available for encrypted comms with another, for your own good and for the good of the culture.

The site currently has very basic though sufficient functionality. This will be expanded on if it sees growth.
