As interest grows in data self-defence, more people are learning to encrypt their own emails. Often, they will learn the skills but find they have nobody to practice with.

	<p>Uniting private communication with the tradition of pen pals.</p>

The skill may fade and their enthusiasm to protect their data goes to waste.

One answer is to find a pen pal to share encrypted emails with.

So I made [cryptopals.org](http://www.cryptopals.org "cryptopals.org")

Find youself a friendly stranger or make yourself available for encrypted comms with another, for your own good and for the good of the culture.
