excerpt: Distributed computer bugs, as exploited by hackers and cyber military agents, level the networked world.

[In a piece for The Atlantic, Bruce Schneier considers](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/should-hackers-fix-cybersecurity-holes-or-exploit-them/371197/) the dynamics of using computer bugs for offensive purposes. Hackers across the world continually seek weaknesses in code, both to exploit and remedy them.

For national security agencies, this is a thorny matter. They covet these bugs as a means to strike their opponents. However, since so much software (and hardware) is shared by people and organisations the world-over, their weaknesses are our weaknesses. If we find a hole and leave it open for when we wish to attack, we usually leave the hole open at home too.

So we see that with shared software, the connected world as one exhibits shared vulnerabilities. Such fragility has aspects a little like climate change, an abstract global vulnerability, which we all have a stake in and incentives to productively engage with.

It is [another](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2009/07/features/the-new-socialism) interesting case study in the equalising effects of the network society. It complicates the psychology of warfare and opposition, creating common ground with enemies, and reducing the productive terrain of attack.
