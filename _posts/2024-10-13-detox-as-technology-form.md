Digital technologies manage more of our lives than ever, often at the expense of our attention span and sense of personal autonomy. Not only this, but the physical shapes our bodies make to interact with our devices can leave us achy or broken.

In my search for alternatives I have started to consider analog approaches as a kind of technology for living with less digital dependence.

I'm thinking about such technology, just like digital technologies, as a landscape of behaviours and mechanisms we can use to improve our lives. Sometimes the improvement is simply being able to get by without digital machines.

**Some examples...**

**The Notephone** â€“ a paper notebook and pen attached to your mobile phone case which invites you to jot notes instead of checking your phone. Poems, letters to friends, life plans: the notephone keeps you entertained, or productive, instead of sinking into your phone again.

**Letter lattices** - games and techniques to tempt you into regular letter-writing practice. For example, writing a physical letter to a friend, say Alex, that includes a message for a mutual friend, Sam, and the request that they write a letter to that friend with your message in it. The intention is that Sam will then send you a letter back, perhaps with another message for someone else, to

I call them technologies since we employ objects and systems in novel ways to tackle modern problems.

Each of them is useful in itself, and we hope to build up a coherent, analogue lifestyle away from the screens.

It doesn't mean breaking away from digital tech entirely, just having the option to live more without relying on "devices".


Digi-detox repository
--------------------

To bring order to this, I introduce the Dedigitox Github repository, a space for the methodical collection of techniques for breaking digital habits or simply expanding your range of non-digital activities.

It includes activities for everything from leisure, relaxation and well-being, to productivity and political organising.

We invite you to suggest any related practices that you think might fit. Please email me with your suggestions or make a pull request to the repository.
