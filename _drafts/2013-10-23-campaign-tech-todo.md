The ground for innovative web developments is fertile.

Here is a mixed, exploratory list of possible, progressive and miscellaneous project sketches.

If any of these are already in existence, I'd [love to hear about it](mailto:info@microsplash.org), if not, I'd be intrigued to see someone make them.


UK Web Filter Solidarity
------------------------

The UK government [has introduced](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2013/sleepwalking-into-censorship) a default filter, run by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) on all web connections to block porn, extremist and also *esoteric* as well as other material of questionable relevance.

That material is to be judged according to the moral sensibilities of the government and ISPs.

The law is problematic for so many reasons.

It has already led to sites, such as sex education resources, being improperly blocked. A cute illustration of how fallible this law is comes as the [Porn filter blocks website of MP who campaigned for it](http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/porn-filter-blocks-website-of-mp-who-campaigned-for-it-50013120/).

Besides this, there are good arguments against forcing all web users to declare their intention to download porn and other 'deviant' material. Designed to protect children from troubling content online, the law would shift responsibility from parents who give children web access to others who access that which the government finds unsavoury.

Death party playlist / Cultural will
------------------------------------

Want boring old pa to choose the sounds at your funeral? Definitely not. Make your final playlist here, and while you're at it, define the terms of the entire party.

Where should the wake be, who can come, even your recommendations for who should get together – cupid from beyond the grave.
