Berlin's Freifunk network is presently planning how to spend a large grant on growing its network.

A member of the group says that, whilst the network has been active and expanding in Berlin for over 10 years, there is still very little content on the network.

However, this is not true of meshnets in Greece or Spain, which are relied upon more by citizens in the absence of good commercial infrastructure.


Can meshnets come to serve as a people's internet, taking over from global ISPs and concommitant problems like the threat to Net Neutrality?
