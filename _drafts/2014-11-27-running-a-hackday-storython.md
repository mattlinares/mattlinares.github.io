Earlier this month, I acted as moderator and technical lead on a hackday in Berlin which brought together journalists, data scientists, activists and others to tell stories about migration in Europe.

The three day event was part of the Slow Politics conference run by the Berliner Gazette. We enjoyed attendance by participants from across the world, with *media hackers* visiting from as far as Los Angeles and Portugal.

My job was to present the topic, associated data, manage the media material, gather the technical pieces into order and help the team work together to its members' strengths.

Our focus was Portugal, a south European country with a stream of emigrants leaving its borders in ever greater numbers, year on year.

After some discussion, we opted to study that phenomenon. We began to piece together numbers, anecdotal evidence, imagery and words to give a sense of how the European crisis has affected the economics and psyche of the nation.

During the event, we were also able to interview two people of Portuguese extraction who left the country and relayed the hopelessness they left their homeland with.

The result was a longform piece which explains and evokes the melancholy of a place losing its people.

We leaned on the following technologies:

- **[Resonate](https://github.com/jplusplus/resonate2014)** rich article template
- **[Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de/)** charts from data
- **[Timeline.js](http://timeline.knightlab.com/)** chronologies and data
- **Google Sheets**, **Fusion Tables** and **Maps**
- **iPad** and **iMovie** on-site video production


There are so many directions an event like this can take, and it's easy for a comparatively large team (there were eight of us) to get lost in the ideas.

Thankfully, we came out with a clear story, fresh material and a genuine contribution to the difficult history of Portugal in the context of a troubled European project.
